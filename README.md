# 2D Rubik's Cube

A modern (but terminal) Python implementation of the Rubik's Cube in 2D.

The implementation is using True Colors and great care was taken to make the terminal experience as nice as possible.

No 3rd party pip packages, pure Python 3.

Compiled to Web with WASM and hosted on https://errge.github.io/sexy/rubik .

Thanks [https://github.com/klao/console-python-web](klao) for helping out with the WASM port.
